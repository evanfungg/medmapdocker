## Welcome to MedMap!

## What it does

MedMap is an interactive site where we have mapped user-inputted data of medication based on effectiveness onto a real-time updating network map. You can see what medication people have used and how effective it was. We would love your input on your medical condition, which medication you took, and the effectiveness of the medication. You may also use our medication search tool to determine other names for medications you may not be familiar with.
